## Experimental Test for the Role of Short-Range Correlations in the EMC Effect
**Published for Beamline for Schools, 2023**

The EMC effect is the observation that cross-sections from deep inelastic scattering off atomic nuclei differ from what one would expect from an equivalent quantity of unbound protons and neutrons. This effect was first observed by the European Muon Corporation nearly four decades ago and is now accepted as concrete evidence that the momentum distributions of quarks differ between free and bound nucleons. This anomaly remains one of the leading unsolved problems in modern particle and nuclear physics, with Short-Range Correlations (SRCs) proposed as a potential explanation.

## Solutions to S.S. Krotov
**Published in the Indian Journal of Physics**

In our collaborative work, we present an extensive collection of solutions to problems in classical mechanics, inspired by the renowned textbook authored by S.S. Krotov. These solutions leverage the principles of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, as well as advanced techniques in complex calculus, to address a diverse range of physical scenarios. By applying rigorous mathematical analysis and clear problem-solving methodologies, we aim to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of classical mechanics concepts and their practical applications. Our solutions offer valuable insights into fundamental principles such as particle motion, energy conservation, and system dynamics, making them an invaluable resource for students and researchers alike.
