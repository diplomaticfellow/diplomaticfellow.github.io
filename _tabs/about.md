# Danial Jeelani

Hello, my name is **Danial Jeelani**. I’ll be graduating high school next spring. My interests mainly lie in Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. I am from the UAE.

## Physics

I have been studying Physics for International Olympiads since 2023, and I will be participating in the UAE Physics Olympiad (UAEPhO) this fall. My favorite topic is Quantum Mechanics, and I am considering writing articles and blog posts on this subject. You can find it in the Writings tab of this site.

## Mathematics

In Mathematics, I am particularly passionate about Calculus and Differential Equations. These areas fascinate me due to their wide range of applications and the deep insights they provide into various phenomena. I have been actively studying these topics to further enhance my understanding and skills.

## Computer Science

I am keenly interested in Computer Science, where I explore different programming languages, algorithms, and computational techniques. This field complements my studies in Physics and Mathematics, providing a solid foundation for problem-solving and analytical thinking.
