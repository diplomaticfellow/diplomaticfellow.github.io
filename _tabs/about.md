# Danial Jeelani

Hello, my name is **Danial Jeelani**. I’ll be graduating high school next spring. My interests mainly lie in Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. I am from the UAE.

## Physics

I have been studying Physics for International Olympiads since 2023, and I will be participating in the UAE Physics Olympiad (UAEPhO) this fall. My favorite topic is Quantum Mechanics, and I am considering writing articles and blog posts on this subject. You can find it in the Writings tab of this site.

## Mathematics

In Mathematics, I am particularly passionate about Calculus and Differential Equations. These areas fascinate me due to their wide range of applications and the deep insights they provide into various phenomena. I have been actively studying these topics to further enhance my understanding and skills.

## Computer Science

I am keenly interested in Computer Science, where I explore different programming languages, algorithms, and computational techniques. This field complements my studies in Physics and Mathematics, providing a solid foundation for problem-solving and analytical thinking.

## Co-Curricular Activities

### COP28 Delegate

As a high school representative, I was selected to attend the COP28 conference in the UAE. This conference focused on climate change advocacy, providing a platform for high school students to voice concerns about increasing CO2 emissions in Dubai and explore potential solutions.

### Beamline for Schools (BL4S) by CERN

My team and I were among the top 30 teams globally, selected out of 3,000 participants in the Beamline for Schools competition organized by CERN. Our project, titled *"Experimental Test for the Role of Short-Range Correlations in the EMC Effect,"* focused on investigating the fundamental aspects of particle physics. Our work was recognized for its scientific innovation and contribution to understanding the EMC Effect.

### Lunar Community Staff Member

I serve as a Physics Staff member for the Lunar Community, a non-profit organization dedicated to hosting mathematics and physics competitions for high school students. This role promotes STEM education and fosters a community of young scholars.

### Marketing Lead, [Non-Profit]

In my role as Marketing Lead at a non-profit organization, I am responsible for driving the organization’s outreach and promotional efforts. My duties include managing social media campaigns, crafting and executing advertisement strategies, and building partnerships with like-minded organizations. I also direct outreach initiatives to increase community engagement and broaden our impact.

### SparX Genius Competition

Selected as one of 10 high school students to participate in the highly anticipated SparX Genius competition, an annual TEDx-style event at my school. During 11th grade, I delivered a speech on "Orwellian Society: Reality or Hoax?" exploring the parallels between George Orwell's dystopian vision and contemporary society.

### Mock Parliament

Participated in a mock Indian Parliament event at my school, which simulated the legislative process of the Indian government. This experience involved role-playing as a member of parliament, debating on key issues, and working on legislative proposals. It enhanced my understanding of political processes and governance while developing my public speaking and negotiation skills.


### Science Competitions and Exhibitions

**GAGAN Inter-School Science Exhibition, Global Indian School, Ajman:**
Represented my school in a competition focused on space exploration. Our team presented a model and research on the potential of wormholes, proposing innovative solutions for future space travel.

**IMMUTO Inter-School Science Fair, India International School, Sharjah:**
At this event, my team and I developed strategies for water waste management and oceanic waste cleanup. We presented practical solutions to address these environmental challenges, showcasing our research and proposed methods.

**Medical & Science Exhibition (MASE), Gulf Medical University:**
Represented my school at the largest science exhibition in the country, with over 3,000 high school participants. Our project involved the development of nanobots designed to target cancer cells with chemotherapy drugs. We created a functional model of the nanobots and developed a companion app for monitoring vitals and connecting patients with healthcare providers.

### Social Work Volunteer

Volunteered during school break times to supervise and ensure that younger students were behaving appropriately. This role involved maintaining a safe and respectful environment, helping resolve conflicts, and setting a positive example for the school community.
