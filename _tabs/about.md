# Danial Jeelani

Hello, I'm Danial Jeelani, and I'll be graduating high school next month. I have a passion for studying and exploring the sciences as a hobby!

## Physics

I’ve been studying Physics for the International Olympiads since 2023 and participated in the UAE Physics Olympiad (UAEPhO) 2024. My favorite subject is Quantum Mechanics, and I plan to write articles and blog posts about it. You can find them in the Writings section of this site.

## Mathematics

In Mathematics, I’m especially passionate about Calculus and Differential Equations. I find these areas fascinating because of their broad applications and the deep insights they offer into different phenomena. I’ve been dedicating time to studying them further to strengthen my understanding and skills.

## Computer Science

I mostly like algorithms because they have a strong mathematical foundation. Right now, I’m focusing on learning competitive programming to sharpen my skills.
